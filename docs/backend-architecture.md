# Backend Architecture

This document describes the Happy backend structure as implemented in `packages/happy-server`. It focuses on how the server is wired, how data flows through the system, and which subsystems handle which responsibilities.

In the server-per-machine architecture, `happy-server` is no longer a multi-tenant cloud relay. Each machine runs its own embedded `happy-server` instance inside `happy-cli`, which is exposed to the operator's mobile device via a Microsoft Dev Tunnel. The standalone `main.ts` entry point is still available for running the server as a process (used in development), but the production deployment shape is "one server per machine, embedded in the CLI."

## At a glance
- Runtime: Node.js + Fastify for HTTP, Socket.IO for realtime.
- Lifecycle: `createHappyServer()` factory in `packages/happy-server/sources/index.ts` starts Fastify in-process from `happy-cli`. A standalone `main.ts` is also retained for non-embedded use.
- Database: PGlite (embedded Postgres) by default via Prisma; external Postgres is opt-in for the standalone deployment shape.
- Cache/bus: Redis is optional. When `REDIS_URL` is set, the Socket.IO Redis-streams adapter is enabled for multi-process fan-out. In the embedded per-machine deployment Redis is not used.
- Blob storage: local filesystem (`<dataDir>/files`) by default; S3-compatible storage is opt-in when `S3_HOST` and friends are set.
- Auth: private Dev Tunnels gateway access is carried by `X-Tunnel-Authorization: tunnel <connect-jwt>` (Microsoft's standard scheme; consumed + stripped by the gateway). After the gateway admits a tunnel request, happy-server uses `tofuConfig.localUserId`; loopback listeners continue to require `X-Loopback-Capability`. An opt-in, default-off **public mode** (`options.auth === "public"`, the single-user `happy.evyatar.dev` server) instead enforces a global default-deny hook + route-policy allowlist, a fail-closed Ed25519 paired-device verifier (device proof + single-use nonce + body-hash binding, primary boundary), and mandatory Cloudflare Access service tokens at the edge — see [Authentication and pairing](#authentication-and-pairing-revised-2026-05-13) and [`docs/security-model.md`](security-model.md#optional-public-mode-single-user-evyatardev-server-opt-in-default-off).
- Crypto: privacy-kit `KeyTree` derived from the per-machine `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET` (set by `createHappyServer()` from the configured `machineKey`). Used only for server-side service-token storage.
- Push: Expo push notifications are delivered directly from happy-server via `sendSessionPushEvent` to tokens stored per (machineId, deviceId).
- Metrics: Prometheus-style `/metrics` server + per-request HTTP metrics.

## Process lifecycle

The primary entry point is `createHappyServer()` in `packages/happy-server/sources/index.ts`, which is called from `happy-cli` to start the server in-process. The standalone `main.ts` simply wraps this factory for the non-embedded mode.

```mermaid

    Close --> AuthDown[auth shutdown]
    AuthDown --> CacheDown[activityCache shutdown]
    CacheDown --> DbDown[disconnectDb]
    DbDown --> LogDown[shutdownLogger]
```

Startup sequence (inside `handle.start()` → `configure()`):
1. Create `<dataDir>/happy-server` and seed `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET` from the configured `machineKey` if it is not already set in the environment.
2. Configure storage:
   - `configureDb({ provider: "pglite", pgliteDir: <dataDir>/happy-server/pglite })` selects PGlite as the default Prisma adapter.
   - `configureFiles({ dataDir, publicUrl })` selects local-filesystem storage by default; S3 is enabled only when an explicit `s3` config is provided.
3. Connect Prisma (`db.$connect()`).
4. Initialize crypto modules:
   - `initEncrypt()` derives a KeyTree from `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET` for service-token encryption.
   - `initGithub()` configures the GitHub App / device-flow integration if env vars exist.
   - `loadFiles()` ensures the local files directory exists (or verifies S3 bucket access when S3 is configured).
   - `auth.init()` prepares legacy internal auth helpers; it no longer authenticates HTTP requests.
5. `startActivityCache()` starts the in-memory presence cache and its batch/cleanup timers.
6. `configureApi(app, tofuConfig)` registers all routes, sockets, and the TOFU `authenticate` decorator on the Fastify instance.
7. `app.listen({ port, host })` binds to the configured loopback address (default `127.0.0.1`).

The standalone `main.ts` additionally starts the metrics server, the database metrics updater, and the presence timeout loop, and registers shutdown hooks. The embedded path lets `happy-cli` decide whether to start those auxiliary loops.

Shutdown calls `handle.stop()`, which closes the Fastify app, shuts down the auth module and activity cache, disconnects the database (and closes the PGlite instance), and flushes the logger.

## API layer

`configureApi()` in `sources/app/api/api.ts` wires the HTTP server:
- Fastify instance with Zod validators/serializers (created via `createApi()`).
- Global hooks for monitoring and error handling.
- `authenticate` decorator that assigns tunnel identity from the embedded server's `localUserId`, while preserving loopback capability checks on loopback listeners.
- A `/files/*` static handler when local-filesystem storage is in use.
- Route modules under `sources/app/api/routes`.
- Socket.IO server attached at `/v1/updates` with the same TOFU handshake check in its middleware.

    end

```

HTTP routes are organized by domain:
- Pairing (`pairRoutes`) - GitHub device-flow + TOFU handshake replacement for the old auth/connect flow.
- Self/account state (`accountRoutes`, `machineSelfRoutes`) - paired profile, local settings, and current machine state under `/v2/me/*`.
- Sessions + messages (`sessionRoutes`, `v3SessionRoutes`).
- Push tokens (`pushRoutes`).
- Version checks (`versionRoutes`).
- Dev-only logging (`devRoutes`).

Sprint E removed the obsolete route modules for artifacts, access keys, key-value store, users/friends/feed, voice, and the server-side machine directory. Multi-tenant account creation, GitHub OAuth-via-server callback, and challenge-based Bearer issuance no longer exist on the server.

## Authentication and pairing (revised 2026-05-13)

    Server-->>Mobile: Response
```

The backend does not store accounts or passwords. Pairing identity comes from `~/.happy/profile.json`, which is written when the operator runs `happy auth login --force` on the daemon machine (one-time GitHub device flow against `Iv1.e7b89e013f801f03`, the public devtunnel OAuth app).

- `POST /pair/complete` is the single pair endpoint. The Dev Tunnels gateway's `X-Tunnel-Authorization: tunnel <connect-jwt>` check is the identity gate; the daemon reads the operator's GitHub identity from profile.json. The mobile client trust-on-first-use pins the daemon's Ed25519 public key on first pair.
- All subsequent HTTP and WebSocket calls present `X-Tunnel-Authorization: tunnel <connect-jwt>` to the gateway. The gateway consumes and strips it, and happy-server assigns the request/socket user id from `tofuConfig.localUserId`.

The gateway connect-token is refreshed by the client via `connectTokenRefresh.ts` against the Dev Tunnels API.

In the opt-in, default-off **public mode** (`options.auth === "public"`, the single-user `happy.evyatar.dev` server) the pairing and per-request auth model is different — identity is a paired device, not a gateway JWT:

- Enrollment starts from a one-time public pairing invite emitted by the daemon (`@slopus/happy-wire` `publicPairingInvite.ts`: base64url `{ version, serverUrl, machineId, pairSecret, cloudflareAccess: { clientId, clientSecret }, issuedAt, expiresAt }`). The app imports it and calls `POST /pair/complete` inside the operator pairing window with the Cloudflare Access headers, the pre-shared pairing secret (`x-happy-pairing-secret`), a single-use pairing nonce (`x-happy-pairing-nonce`), and its Ed25519 device public key. The server TOFU-pins that device key (`enroll()`), immediately visible to both the HTTP guard and the Socket.IO handshake; a conflicting key for a pinned device id → `409`.
- All subsequent HTTP and WebSocket calls present an Ed25519 device proof in `x-happy-device-proof` (single-use nonce, freshness-bounded, signature bound to method + path, plus a `preValidation` body-hash guard). As edge defense-in-depth, Cloudflare Access forwards a signed `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` JWT (the `CF-Access-Client-Id` / `CF-Access-Client-Secret` service-token headers are stripped at the edge), which the origin cryptographically verifies against the team-domain JWKS (signature + `iss` + `aud` + `exp`). Any un-allowlisted route, missing/invalid proof, body-hash mismatch, or missing/invalid edge assertion fails closed. The verifier is the primary boundary; Cloudflare Access is mandatory edge defense-in-depth. Full threat model in [`docs/security-model.md`](security-model.md#optional-public-mode-single-user-evyatardev-server-opt-in-default-off).
- The Socket.IO handshake verifier covers both websocket and polling transports; because the socket nonce is strict single-use, public-mode clients connect with `reconnection: false` and a single transport.

The legacy `auth` module (`sources/app/auth/auth.ts`) still exists and is initialized at startup, but it is no longer used to authenticate HTTP requests. It is retained for internal helpers (e.g., the GitHub ephemeral token used by integrations) and for the standalone deployment shape.

## Realtime sync architecture

    subgraph Connections
        U1[Mobile Client - user-scoped]
        S1[Mobile Client - session-scoped]
        M1[Machine Daemon - machine-scoped]
    end

        subgraph Scopes
            US[user-scoped]

        end
    end

    U1 --> Auth --> US
    S1 --> Auth --> SS
    M1 --> Auth --> MS

    US & SS & MS --> Router

    Router --> |persistent update| DB[(PGlite)]
    Router --> |ephemeral event| Clients((Filtered Recipients))
```

### Connection types
Socket.IO connections are tagged by scope at handshake time:
- `user-scoped`: receives all updates for the local user.
- `session-scoped`: receives updates only for one session.
- `machine-scoped`: daemon connections for machine state.

The Socket.IO middleware in `sources/app/api/socket.ts` enforces the same tunnel/loopback gate as the HTTP layer before any connection is accepted, then attaches `userId`, `clientType`, `sessionId`, `machineId`, and the TOFU public keys to `socket.data`. On connection, it emits a `tofu-pubkeys` event so clients that connected via Socket.IO directly can perform the TOFU pin. In public mode the middleware instead runs the Ed25519 device-proof handshake verifier on both the websocket and polling transports (fixed proof binding `GET /v1/updates`, single-use nonce), rejecting any handshake without a valid proof + Cloudflare Access headers.

### Event router
`EventRouter` (`sources/app/events/eventRouter.ts`) maintains per-user connection sets and routes:
- **Persistent `update` events**: database-backed changes with a user-level monotonic `seq`.
- **Ephemeral events**: presence signals that are not persisted.
- **`agent-tree-update` events**: codex spawn-tree deltas fanned out to all connections interested in a given session via the `all-interested-in-session` filter (both session-scoped and user-scoped subscribers). Not persisted and not replayed; emitted as a distinct event name so clients that don't decode the agent-tree shape can ignore it. See [happy-wire.md](./happy-wire.md) for the payload schema.

The router implements recipient filters so updates go only to interested connections (e.g., all session listeners or a specific machine).

### Update sequence numbers
- A per-user `seq` counter is allocated by `allocateUserSeq` and used as `UpdatePayload.seq`. There is no longer an `Account` row backing it; in the single-tenant schema the counter is maintained by the seq helper.
- Sessions and machines maintain their own `seq` for per-object ordering.

### Multi-process Redis adapter (optional)
When `REDIS_URL` is set, `startSocket()` attaches `@socket.io/redis-streams-adapter` so multiple server processes can share Socket.IO state and a `redisStreamLagMsGauge` metric tracks reader lag. The embedded per-machine deployment never sets `REDIS_URL`, so this code path is dormant.

## Presence and activity

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "High Frequency"
        Events[session-alive / machine-alive]
        Cache[Activity Cache]
    end

    subgraph "Batched Writes"
        Batch[Batch Processor]
        DB[(PGlite)]
    end

    subgraph "Timeout Loop"
        Timer[10 min timer]
        Offline[Mark Inactive]
        Emit[Emit offline update]
    end

    Events --> |debounce| Cache
    Cache --> |batch| Batch --> DB
    Timer --> Cache
    Cache --> |stale entries| Offline --> DB
    Offline --> Emit
```

Presence is handled in `sources/app/presence`:
- `session-alive` and `machine-alive` events are debounced in memory (`ActivityCache`) with a 30-second TTL and a 5-second batch interval.
- Database writes are batched to reduce write load.
- A timeout loop marks sessions/machines inactive after 10 minutes of silence and emits an offline ephemeral update.

This splits high-frequency presence from durable storage updates.

## Storage and persistence

### Database (Prisma)

The schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` is single-tenant — there is no `Account`, `GithubUser`, or `AccountPushToken` model. All entities belong to the single embedded server's local user.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Session ||--o{ SessionMessage : contains
    Machine ||--o{ PushToken : has

    Session {
        string id
        string tag
        string metadata
        int metadataVersion
        string agentState
        bytes dataEncryptionKey
        int seq
        bool active
    }

    SessionMessage {
        string id
        string sessionId
        int seq
        json content
    }

    Machine {
        string id
        string metadata
        string daemonState
        bytes dataEncryptionKey
        int seq
        bool active
    }

    PushToken {
        string id
        string machineId
        string deviceId
        string expoPushToken
    }

```

Key tables:
- `Session` + `SessionMessage`: encrypted session metadata and message blobs.
- `Machine`: encrypted machine metadata + daemon state for the local machine and any peer machines.
- `PushToken`: per-`(machineId, deviceId)` Expo push tokens. The previous `AccountPushToken` model has been replaced by this single-tenant table.

### Transactions and retries

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([inTx call]) --> Begin[Begin Transaction]
    Begin --> |Serializable| Exec[Execute Operations]
    Exec --> Commit{Commit}

    Commit --> |Success| After[afterTx callbacks]
    After --> Emit[Emit Socket Updates]
    Emit --> Done([Complete])

    Commit --> |P2034 Error| Retry{Retry?}
    Retry --> |Yes| Begin
    Retry --> |Max retries| Fail([Throw Error])
```

`inTx()` wraps Prisma transactions with:
- Serializable isolation.
- Automatic retry on `P2034` (serialization failures).
- `afterTx()` to emit socket updates after commit.

This pattern is used for multi-write operations like session deletion.

### Blob storage (local-first)
The default storage backend is the local filesystem under `<dataDir>/files`:
- `storage/files.ts` exposes `configureFiles({ dataDir, publicUrl, s3? })`. With no `s3` config, `useLocalStorage` is `true` and `loadFiles()` simply ensures the local directory exists.
- A `/files/*` route is registered on the Fastify instance when local storage is in use, serving files within the configured directory.

S3-compatible storage is opt-in. Provide an `s3` block (or set `S3_HOST`/`S3_BUCKET`/`S3_PUBLIC_URL`/etc.) and the same module switches to MinIO-style uploads with public URLs derived from `S3_PUBLIC_URL`.

### Redis (optional)
A Redis client is no longer constructed at startup. Redis is consulted only by the Socket.IO multi-process adapter, which is enabled lazily when `REDIS_URL` is set. The embedded per-machine deployment runs without Redis.

## Push notifications

Push delivery is owned by happy-server in the per-machine architecture. The CLI no longer talks to Expo directly.

- `pushRoutes` exposes `POST /push/register`, `POST /v1/push-tokens`, `DELETE /v1/push-tokens/:token`, and `GET /v1/push-tokens`. All four endpoints are gated by the `authenticate` decorator and bind tokens to the `tofuConfig.localUserId` plus a per-device `deviceId`.
- `registerPushToken` upserts a row in the `PushToken` table keyed by `(machineId, deviceId)`.
- `sendSessionPushEvent` (in `sources/app/push/pushNotifications.ts`) is called from session-update handlers to push a notification for `new-session`, `status-change`, `agent-message`, or `codex-finish` events. It calls `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send` directly with a body that includes `to`, `title`, `body`, `sound: "default"`, `priority: "high"`, and a `data` payload with `machineId`, `sessionId`, `kind`, and a deep-link `url`.
- Failed responses are logged but do not block the calling write transaction.

## Data confidentiality model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client-side Encryption"
        C1[Session metadata]
        C2[Agent state]
        C3[Daemon state]
        C4[Message content]
    end

    subgraph "Server-side Encryption"
        S1[GitHub OAuth tokens]
    end

    C1 & C2 & C3 & C4 --> |opaque blobs| DB[(PGlite)]
    S1 --> |KeyTree from HANDY_MASTER_SECRET| DB

    style C1 fill:#e1f5fe
    style C2 fill:#e1f5fe
    style C3 fill:#e1f5fe
    style C4 fill:#e1f5fe
    style S1 fill:#fff3e0
```

- Session metadata, agent state, daemon state, and message content are stored as opaque encrypted strings or blobs.
- The server only encrypts/decrypts GitHub OAuth material it owns using the KeyTree derived from `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET`. In the embedded deployment that secret is the per-machine `machineKey` configured by `happy-cli`, not a shared cloud master.

## Integrations
- **GitHub**: device-flow OAuth is no longer wired into HTTP routes. Operator identity is read at pair time from `~/.happy/profile.json` (written when the operator runs `happy auth login --force` on the daemon machine via the one-time devtunnel GitHub device flow). The previous `HAPPY_TUNNEL_GITHUB_OWNER` env var and per-machine `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` are removed.
- **Push tokens**: stored per `(machineId, deviceId)` for direct Expo delivery.

## Observability
- `/health` route checks DB connectivity.
- Metrics server exposes `/metrics` for Prometheus.
- HTTP request counters and duration histograms are captured via Fastify hooks.
- WebSocket event counters and connection gauges are in `metrics2.ts`.
