# Handy Server - Development Guidelines

This document contains the development guidelines and instructions for the Happy Server project. This guide OVERRIDES any default behaviors and MUST be followed exactly.

## Architecture posture (Sprint A onward)

happy-server **runs embedded inside each user's daemon process**, not as a
standalone multi-tenant service. The codexu fork dropped the public hosted
deployment after Sprint A landed `createHappyServer()` + `dualListenerBinding()`
in happy-cli's daemon. There is **exactly one user per process**.

Consequence for the code surface: request decorators, socket handlers,
`eventRouter` fan-out, presence validation, and update sequence allocation are
single-process surfaces. Do not reintroduce per-request or per-socket `userId`
threading in `sources/`; auth still validates the operator boundary, but route
and socket code should not carry a tenant identity just to scope updates.

The "Local Development" section below still describes how to run the server
in standalone mode for testing; production use is via the embedded path in
the daemon.

### Ring buffer replay state

Reconnect replay in `sources/app/events/eventRouter.ts` uses a flat
`BufferedUpdate[]` plus a module-scoped `let currentSeq`, not a map keyed by
`userId`. Socket.IO rooms are process-scoped (`session:<id>`, `machine:<id>`,
`user-scoped`, plus the internal authenticated broadcast room), and the buffer
retains only the latest 1024 update events; there is no age eviction. This is
valid because `packages/happy-cli/src/daemon/dualListenerBinding.ts` runs one
embedded happy-server daemon per operator, and `sources/storage/seq.ts`
currently allocates a process-local update sequence for that daemon.

`allocateUpdateSeq()` must run before `EventRouterSink.emitUpdate(...)`, and
`emitUpdate(...)` appends to the replay buffer only after the payload's `seq`
exists. Cross-process or cross-cluster replay is intentionally deferred. If the
daemon deployment invariant is relaxed, re-introduce userId checks together in
the presence cache, eventRouter room scheme, replay buffer partitioning, and
update sequence allocation; changing only one of those surfaces creates a false
sense of tenant isolation.

## Project Overview

**Name**: happy-server  
**Repository**: https://github.com/slopus/happy-server.git  
**License**: MIT  
**Language**: TypeScript  
**Runtime**: Node.js 20  
**Framework**: Fastify with opinionated architecture  

## Core Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Web Framework**: Fastify 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Validation**: Zod
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Cache/Pub-Sub**: Redis (via ioredis)

- **Package Manager**: pnpm (not npm)

## Development Environment

### Local Development (Recommended)

Use standalone mode for local development — no Docker, PostgreSQL, or Redis needed:

```bash
pnpm standalone:dev
```

This loads env from `.env.dev`, runs migrations with PGlite (embedded Postgres), and starts the server on port 3005. Data is stored in `./data/pglite/`.

Only two env vars are required for standalone (both already in `.env.dev`):
- `HANDY_MASTER_SECRET` - master secret for auth/encryption
- `PORT` - server port (default: 3005)

### Commands
- `pnpm build` - TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm standalone:dev` - Start server with PGlite + .env.dev (recommended for local dev)
- `pnpm standalone` - Start server with PGlite (no env file, you provide env vars)
- `pnpm dev` - Start with external Postgres + Redis (requires Docker, see Production section)
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm generate` - Generate Prisma client

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles
- Use 4 spaces for tabs (not 2 spaces)
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- All sources must be imported using "@/" prefix (e.g., `import "@/utils/log"`)
- Always use absolute imports
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety

```

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- When writing utility functions, always name file and function the same way
- Test files should have ".spec.ts" suffix

## Tool Usage

### Web Search and Fetching
- When in doubt, use web tool to get answers from the web
- Search web when you have some failures

### File Operations
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

## Utilities

### Writing Utility Functions
1. Always name file and function the same way for easy discovery
2. Utility functions should be modular and not too complex
3. Always write tests for utility functions BEFORE writing the code
4. Iterate implementation and tests until the function works as expected
5. Always write documentation for utility functions

## Modules

### Module Guidelines
- Modules are bigger than utility functions and abstract away complexity
- Each module should have a dedicated directory
- Modules usually don't have application-specific logic
- Modules can depend on other modules, but not on application-specific logic
- Prefer to write code as modules instead of application-specific code

### When to Use Modules
- When integrating with external services
- When abstracting complexity of some library
- When implementing related groups of functions (math, date, etc.)

### Known Modules
- **ai**: AI wrappers to interact with AI services
- **eventbus**: Event bus to send and receive events between modules and applications
- **lock**: Simple lock to synchronize access to resources in the whole cluster
- **media**: Tools to work with media files

## Applications

- Applications contain application-specific logic
- Applications have the most complexity; other parts should assist by reducing complexity
- When using prompts, write them to "_prompts.ts" file relative to the application

## Database

### Prisma Usage
- Prisma is used as ORM
- Use "inTx" to wrap database operations in transactions
- Do not update schema without absolute necessity
- For complex fields, use "Json" type
- NEVER DO MIGRATION YOURSELF. Only run pnpm generate when new types needed

### Current Schema Status
The project has pending Prisma migrations that need to be applied:
- Migration: `20250715012822_add_metadata_version_agent_state`

## Events

### Event Bus
- eventbus allows sending and receiving events inside the process and between different processes
- eventbus is local or redis based
- Use "afterTx" to send events after transaction is committed successfully instead of directly emitting events

## Testing

- Write tests using Vitest
- Test files should be named the same as source files with ".spec.ts" suffix
- For utility functions, write tests BEFORE implementation

## API Development

- API server is in `/sources/apps/api`
- Routes are in `/sources/apps/api/routes`
- Use Fastify with Zod for type-safe route definitions
- Always validate inputs using Zod
- **Idempotency**: Design all operations to be idempotent - clients may retry requests automatically and the backend must handle multiple invocations of the same operation gracefully, producing the same result as a single invocation

### Sprint E Route Inventory

The active route surface is intentionally small: `pairRoutes`, `accountRoutes`, `machineSelfRoutes`, `sessionRoutes`, `v3SessionRoutes`, `pushRoutes`, `versionRoutes`, and `devRoutes`. The obsolete artifact, feed, voice, key-value, access-key, user/friends, usage, and machine-directory modules were deleted in Sprint E and must not be re-registered without a new plan.

The Scope A agent-comms ingest route (`POST /agent-comms/ingest`) is intentionally **not** a happy-server route. It was moved out of the embedded server to a happy-cli-owned standalone Fastify listener on a second forwarded Dev Tunnel port (D-004 Option A); its request-shape schema and hop check live in `@slopus/happy-wire`. Do not re-add `agentCommsIngestRoutes` here — the embedded server must 404 on that path.

In the opt-in, default-off public mode (`options.auth === "public"`), this route surface is additionally protected by a **global default-deny** `onRequest` hook installed before route registration plus an explicit `PUBLIC_ROUTE_POLICY_ALLOWLIST` (in `app/api/auth/remoteDeviceAuth.ts`): any method/path not on the allowlist returns `401`. Adding a new route therefore requires deliberately assigning it a policy (`deviceProof` or the pre-enrollment `pairComplete`) — a new route fails closed until it is. The decisive acceptance test derives the route inventory from the live Fastify app and asserts every non-allowlisted route returns `401` with no key material.

### Pair protocol (BOOX-validated 2026-05-13)

`pairRoutes` exposes **one** pair endpoint: `POST /pair/complete`. Identity is read
from the locally-onboarded `~/.happy/profile.json` (written by `happy auth login --force`);
the Dev Tunnels gateway's `X-Tunnel-Authorization` check is the only identity gate.

- The earlier `/pair/start` (GET) + `/pair/status` (POST) two-step device flow,
  along with the per-machine `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `HAPPY_TUNNEL_GITHUB_OWNER`
  env vars, are **deleted**. They were redundant on a personal fork because
  tunnel ownership already proves operator identity.
- `/pair/complete` is the single pair endpoint and does not mint or refresh a
  Happy-specific tunnel claim.
- `/pair/connect` (separate post-pair re-auth endpoint) is retained.

In public mode, `/pair/complete` is the only pre-enrollment route (allowlist policy `pairComplete`): it passes the Cloudflare Access edge check but requires no device proof (the device is not yet paired), and the handler enforces the operator pairing window + a pre-shared pairing secret (`x-happy-pairing-secret`) + a single-use pairing nonce (`x-happy-pairing-nonce`). Only inside the window with a valid secret does it return key material and TOFU-pin the app's Ed25519 device key (`enroll()`), immediately visible to both the HTTP guard and the Socket.IO handshake; a conflicting key for a pinned device id → `409` (`device_key_conflict`). `/pair/connect` is a `deviceProof` route in public mode.

### Tunnel-auth headers (BOOX-validated 2026-05-13, updated after claim removal)

Microsoft's Dev Tunnels gateway consumes `X-Tunnel-Authorization: tunnel <connect-jwt>`
and strips it before forwarding to the backend, so happy-server normally never
sees that header. The removed Happy-specific daemon claim header must not be
reintroduced. Tunnel requests collapse to `tofuConfig.localUserId`; loopback
requests continue to require `X-Loopback-Capability`.

CORS allowlists in `app/api/api.ts` and `app/api/socket.ts` include
`X-Tunnel-Authorization` for browser preflight pass-through to the gateway.

### Public-mode auth plane (opt-in, single-user `happy.evyatar.dev`)

Shipped and verified 2026-07 (`options.auth === "public"`, default-off; the
single-user public server). This mode does not delegate identity to a gateway —
it enforces a fail-closed application-layer boundary in
`app/api/auth/remoteDeviceAuth.ts` as the **primary** boundary, with Cloudflare
Access service tokens as **mandatory edge defense-in-depth**. Full threat model:
[`docs/security-model.md` → Optional Public Mode](../../docs/security-model.md#optional-public-mode-single-user-evyatardev-server-opt-in-default-off).

- **Ed25519 device proof.** Every `deviceProof` request must carry
  `x-happy-device-proof` — a base64 JSON envelope from `@slopus/happy-wire`
  (`publicDeviceAuth.ts`) whose canonical string binds `method + path + keyId +
  publicKey + nonce + issuedAt + bodyHash`. Verification is fail-closed:
  well-formed → pinned public key → freshness (5-min window, +1-min skew) →
  single-use nonce → signature over method + path. The verifier is **mutable**
  (`enroll()` TOFU-pins device keys) and shared across HTTP + socket transports
  so a nonce is consumed exactly once everywhere.
- **Body-hash binding.** A `preValidation` guard recomputes the raw body's
  SHA-256 and rejects (`401`) unless it matches the signed `bodyHash`; it
  fail-closes when the raw body cannot be captured. The `onRequest` guard only
  verifies method + path because it runs before body parse.
- **Socket.IO handshake.** The proof is required on both the websocket and
  polling transports (fixed binding `GET /v1/updates`); the old fail-open tunnel
  branch is closed. Because the socket nonce is strict single-use, clients
  connect `reconnection: false` + single transport.
- **Cloudflare Access edge.** Real Cloudflare Access strips the
  `CF-Access-Client-Id` / `CF-Access-Client-Secret` service-token headers before
  the origin and forwards a signed `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` JWT instead. The
  origin verifies that assertion in `app/api/auth/edgeAssertion.ts` (via
  `jose`: `createRemoteJWKSet` against the team-domain JWKS + `jwtVerify`
  checking signature + `iss` + `aud` + `exp`), fail-closed on any
  missing/malformed/expired/wrong-aud/wrong-iss token and on JWKS-fetch failure.
  `isEdgeAllowed` in `remoteDeviceAuth.ts` routes to the assertion verifier when
  `edge.assertion` (team domain + AUD) is configured, and falls back to the
  legacy sync `checkEdgeAccess` service-token check only when it is not. The
  edge itself still returns `403` on an unauthenticated request.
- CORS allowlists in `app/api/api.ts` and `app/api/socket.ts` additionally
  include the device-proof and `x-happy-pairing-secret` / `x-happy-pairing-nonce`
  headers for browser preflight. The `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header is NOT
  listed: browsers never send it (Cloudflare Access injects it at the edge).
- Uses `privacyKit.decodeBase64` / `encodeBase64` for envelope bytes; keep the
  4-space-tab, `.spec.ts` conventions when touching this module.

## Production Deployment (NOT needed for local standalone dev)

The following is only relevant for production or when running with `pnpm dev` (external Postgres + Redis mode).

### External Dependencies (production only)
- PostgreSQL database (`DATABASE_URL`)
- Redis (`REDIS_URL`) - for event bus and cross-process pub/sub
- S3/MinIO (`S3_HOST`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, etc.) - for file storage
- FFmpeg - for media processing
- Python3

### Commands (production only)
- `pnpm dev` - Start with .env and .env.dev (requires external Postgres + Redis)
- `pnpm migrate` - Run Prisma migrations against external Postgres
- `pnpm db` - Start local PostgreSQL in Docker
- `pnpm redis` - Start local Redis in Docker
- `pnpm s3` - Start local MinIO in Docker

### Docker Deployment

The project includes a multi-stage Dockerfile:
1. Builder stage: Installs dependencies and builds the application
2. Runner stage: Minimal runtime with only necessary files
3. Exposes port 3000
4. Requires FFmpeg and Python3 in the runtime

## Important Reminders

1. Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
2. NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
3. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
4. NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
5. Use 4 spaces for tabs (not 2 spaces)
6. Use pnpm instead of npm for all package management
7. Public library imports must be side-effect free. Timers, DB clients, file storage clients, logger transports, and process handlers need explicit start/stop wiring behind `createHappyServer()` or standalone `main.ts`.
8. Push notifications are server-owned in the per-machine architecture. Store Expo tokens by local machine/device and call Expo from happy-server; CLI should only emit session events.

## Debugging Notes

### Remote Logging Setup
- Use `DANGEROUSLY_LOG_TO_SERVER_FOR_AI_AUTO_DEBUGGING=true` env var to enable
- Server logs to `.logs/` directory with timestamped files (format: `MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.log`)
- Mobile and CLI send logs to `/logs-combined-from-cli-and-mobile-for-simple-ai-debugging` endpoint

### Common Issues & Tells

#### Socket/Connection Issues
- **Tell**: "Sending update to user-scoped connection" but mobile not updating
- **Tell**: Multiple "User disconnected" messages indicate socket instability
- **Tell**: "Response from the Engine was empty" = Prisma database connection lost

#### Auth Flow Debugging
- CLI must hit `/v1/auth/request` to create auth request
- Mobile scans QR and hits `/v1/auth/response` to approve
- **Tell**: 404 on `/v1/auth/response` = server likely restarted/crashed
- **Tell**: "Auth failed - user not found" = token issue or user doesn't exist

#### Session Creation Flow
- Sessions created via POST `/v1/sessions` with tag-based deduplication
- Server emits "new-session" update to all user connections
- **Tell**: Sessions created but not showing = mobile app not processing updates
- **Tell**: "pathname /" in mobile logs = app stuck at root screen

#### Environment Variables
- CLI: Use `pnpm dev:local-server` (NOT `pnpm dev`) to load `.env.dev-local-server`
- Server: Use `pnpm dev` to start with proper env files
- **Tell**: Wrong server URL = check `HAPPY_SERVER_URL` env var
- **Tell**: Wrong home dir = check `HAPPY_HOME_DIR` (should be `~/.happy-dev` for local)

### Quick Diagnostic Commands

#### IMPORTANT: Always Start Debugging With These
```bash
# 1. CHECK CURRENT TIME - Logs use local time, know what's current!
date

# 2. CHECK LATEST LOG FILES - Server creates new logs on restart
ls -la .logs/*.log | tail -5

# 3. VERIFY YOU'RE LOOKING AT CURRENT LOGS
# Server logs are named: MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.log (month-day-hour-min-sec)
# If current time is 13:45 and latest log is 08-15-10-57-02.log from 10:57,
# that log started 3 hours ago but may still be active!
tail -1 .logs/[LATEST_LOG_FILE]  # Check last entry timestamp
```

#### Common Debugging Patterns
```bash
# Check server logs for errors
tail -100 .logs/*.log | grep -E "(error|Error|ERROR|failed|Failed)"

# Monitor session creation
tail -f .logs/*.log | grep -E "(new-session|Session created)"

# Check active connections
tail -100 .logs/*.log | grep -E "(Token verified|User connected|User disconnected)"

# See what endpoints are being hit
tail -100 .logs/*.log | grep "incoming request"

# Debug socket real-time updates
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep -A 2 -B 2 "new-session" | tail -30
tail -200 .logs/*.log | grep -E "(websocket|Socket.*connected|Sending update)" | tail -30

# Track socket events from mobile client
tail -300 .logs/*.log | grep "remote-log.*mobile" | grep -E "(SyncSocket|handleUpdate)" | tail -20

# Monitor session creation flow end-to-end
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep "session-create" | tail -20
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep "cmed556s4002bvb2020igg8jf" -A 3 -B 3  # Replace with actual session ID

# Check auth flow for sessions API
tail -300 .logs/*.log | grep "auth-decorator.*sessions" | tail -10

# Debug machine registration and online status
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep -E "(machine-alive|machine-register|update-machine)" | tail -20
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep "GET /v2/me/machine" | tail -10

# Check what mobile app is seeing
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep "📊 Storage" | tail -20
tail -500 .logs/*.log | grep "applySessions.*active" | tail -10
```

#### Time Format Reference
- **CLI logs**: `[HH:MM:SS.mmm]` in local time (e.g., `[13:45:23.738]`)
- **Server logs**: Include both `time` (Unix ms) and `localTime` (HH:MM:ss.mmm)
- **Mobile logs**: Sent with `timestamp` in UTC, converted to `localTime` on server
- **All consolidated logs**: Have `localTime` field for easy correlation
- When writing a some operations on db, like adding friend, sending a notification - always create a dedicated file in relevant subfolder of the @sources/app/ folder. Good example is "friendAdd", always prefix with an entity type, then action that should be performed.
- Never create migrations yourself, it is can be done only by human
- Do not return stuff from action functions "just in case", only essential
- Do not add logging when not asked
- do not run non-transactional things (like uploadign files) in transactions
- After writing an action - add a documentation comment that explains logic, also keep it in sync.
- always use github usernames
- Always use privacyKit.decodeBase64 and privacyKit.encodeBase64 from privacy-kit instead of using buffer
